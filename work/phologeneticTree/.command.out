RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences OR482142.1 and OR481953.1 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences OQ103295.1 and OQ103290.1 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences OQ103291.1 and OQ103289.1 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences OQ103259.1 and OQ103256.1 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences OQ103257.1 and OQ103253.1 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 5 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file aligned_sequences.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
